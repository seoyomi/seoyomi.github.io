layout: post

1. Frist, find the `_post` folder where your blog posts will live.

2. Then create a file which has to be named according to the following format.

   ```
   YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
   ```

   ```
   2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
   2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md
   ```

3. Once you made a file, it is better to add this code.

   ```markdown
   ---
   layout: post
   ---
   ```

   It will make your post fit the template.
